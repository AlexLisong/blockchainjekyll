TraceSafe, BCX's wholly-owned subsidiary, has entered into advanced pilot stage programs for its TRACEsafe technology with Kuwait and an additional Southeast Asian country. These countries build-off the continued success of the TRACEsafe technology in Hong Kongâ€™s COVID-19 containment program as each strengthens its own program in the fight against Covid-19.
