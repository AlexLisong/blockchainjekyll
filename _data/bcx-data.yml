  # BCX Data


  BCX Data offers the most comprehensive and accurate dataset in the
  cryptocurrency industry.


  BCX uses three proprietary indexes along with standard measurements to gauge
  the value of any currency, allowing you to make informed decisions without
  having to deep dive into the crypto world.


  ## TCMI


  The Total Crypto Momentum Index offers investors and fund managers a way to
  get greater returns on cryptocurrency investments without the need to
  understand every crypto project.


  The index focuses on momentum, one of the most powerful predictors of market
  returns, as well as market capitalization and proprietary data on real world
  usage and developer engagement gathered from thousands of touch-points across
  the web. Using a combination of these criteria, the TCIM enables investors to
  quantitatively re-balance portfolios of liquid cryptocurrency assets and get
  the greatest returns in the winner-takes-all market dynamic so common to new
  technologies


  ## DII


  The Developer Interest Index, gives at a glance, an overview of how much
  developer interest there is in a crypto currency project. By learning about
  the contributions from developers, we can gauge if a project will rapidly
  develop in improvements, or not.
