  Through our proprietary portal bcxdata.com, Blockchain Holdings gives traders
  and developers a way to quantitatively measure the value of cryptocurrencies
  and alt-coins.




  This portal captures the myriad of different blockchains available, and we use
  meaningful data to reveal valuable cryptocurrencies ready for investment on a
  clean and approachable platform.




  We offer unique insights into the growing ecosystem of crypto-assets, allowing
  asset managers to access our data directly, while large funds can connect
  programmatically to our system.




  Our proprietary technology includes the BCX Total Crypto Momentum Index, which
  offers investors a way to capture a greater returns without the need to
  understand every crypto project.




  Meanwhile, our Developer Interest Index measures how committed open source
  developers are to a project, so investors can make informed decisions about a
  projectâ€™s financial viability.




  And our Anti-Money Laundering Index is a black market money tracking tool
  allowing investors to get accurate estimates of the coins being used for both
  legal and illegal activities.




  Available on a subscription or pay-as-you-go basis, our portfolio of
  proprietary tools aims to give investors and fund managers the edge they need
  in this expanding and explosive market.
